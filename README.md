# CPPND: Program a Concurrent Traffic Simulation

<img src="data/traffic_simulation.gif"/>

This is the project for the fourth course in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213): Concurrency. 

The starter code of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Program-a-Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation).  
In this project, the concentration was given to parallel programming regarding multithreading and how to avoid deadlocks and data races. C++ features were used to achieve this goal.
