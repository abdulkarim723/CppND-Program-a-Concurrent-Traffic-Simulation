# CPPND: Program a Concurrent Traffic Simulation
## Workflow in Linux
- clone the repo and go inside the cloned repo
```
git clone https://github.com/abdulkarim723/CppND-Program-a-Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation && cd CppND-Program-a-Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation
```
- create a build directory, cmake inside the build directory and then make as follows
```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../ && make
```
- run the created binary file as follows
```
./traffic_simulation 
```
For a successful running, one should see something similar to the following:

This is the project for the fourth course in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213): Concurrency. 

The starter code of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Program-a-Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation).  
In this project, the concentration was given to concurrent programming regarding multithreading and how to avoid deadlocks and data races. C++ features were used to achieve this goal.
